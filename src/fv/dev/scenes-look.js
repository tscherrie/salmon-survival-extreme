// scenes listed here join the list in scenes.js, and a scene with `look: true` is run by
// runLook below instead of the generic runner.
//
// The bench (scene "bench", driven by tools/fv-bench.mjs) weighs combat against its budget:
// all of it together may take at most 1.5 ms of the graphics card's frame and 1 ms of script.
// It holds fights of a fixed size in one place and tops them up as things die, so every
// frame carries the same load: a fight of four players as the game can have it today (40
// enemies firing their own guns at their own pace, and as many laser bolts as four players
// firing without pause keep in the water), and a stress case well beyond it (150 players'
// shots and 60 enemy rounds held in flight). Both are timed against the same place and
// camera with no fight, several times over. Then it looks for where the time goes: the
// card's share by showing and hiding combat's meshes in turns, parts of the script swapped
// for variants in turns, the fight scaled up and down, and the river lookups timed on their
// own. Everything is changed from here, at run time; the combat files stay as they are.
//
// Any other scene run with ?xtiming (fv-test --timing) gets what combat.step and
// combat.frame cost added to its report.
//
// (The bench's code comes first and the list of scenes with runLook last: scenes added below
// runLook on other branches then never touch the bench's lines when the branches merge.)
