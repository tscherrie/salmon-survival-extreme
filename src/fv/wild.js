// The base game's own hunters give way to Extreme's enemies (enemies.js): the ones in the
// water no longer take up their places, the kingfisher and the heron stay away, and the

// difficulty levels have taken its place, and Tourist borrows its easing of the current
// (difficulty.js). Rival young salmon still
// hold their spots but no longer nip: salmon are never enemies here. The heartbeat is left
// out: with enemies about nearly all the time it would never stop (the user found it
// grating). Nothing in the base files changes; their tables and objects are adjusted from
