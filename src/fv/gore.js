// Splatter: what a hit and a kill leave in the water. The joke of Extreme is the contrast
// between the calm river and weapons that are meant seriously, so this is meant seriously
// too, and it grows with the weapon: the little laser leaves a puff, a fizz of steam and a
// dead fish trailing a thin red thread and smoke from a burnt pinhole; heavier weapons
// tear the exit side open; the big guns (weapons.js: bursts) burst the fish whatever its
// size: a billowing cloud, flecks, silver scales, and chunks of
// flesh flung out hard, which the water stops at once (as it stops the bullets: the user's
// rule since 26.09), then sinking slowly and drifting with the current until they lie on the
// gravel. Blood drifts with the current (the same water that carries the motes), darkens
// from crimson to rust as it thins, and fades over some seconds.
//
// The chunks are food ("Kampf nährt das Leben", plan part 2): each is worth its share of
// what the fish weighed, and the salmon eats them as it eats the drift (combat.js with
// remains.js, which cap what fighting feeds). While this fish can eat them they glow warm
// as a morsel does (feed() says who eats, frame() lights them), and the nearest in front is
// marked for it (nearest()). They are this page's own pool, not life.js's drift, so nothing
// else eats them -- not the armed school, not the rival young salmon.
//
// Three draws: the clouds (one sprite cloud, sorted back to front each frame so they blend
// right), the small hard bits (flecks, scales, steam beads, embers: a cut-out sprite cloud
// that writes depth, so it needs no sorting) and the chunks (one instanced mesh). The pools
// have a fixed size (half on light settings) and are filled in place; nothing is allocated
// per frame. Everything sits on layer 1 (fx.js), which the mirror and the window cameras
// leave out.
//
// What it leaves on the enemy record: `burst` (the fish came apart: nothing is left to
// sink, the chunks are its remains), `wound` (0..1, how badly the fish that sinks whole is
// torn; its bleeding follows it), `burnt` (the wound was burnt), and where the last shot went
// in (`woundAlong`, `woundUp`, in body lengths); `seared`, the flame or the arc killed it and
// it bleeds no more. A burst fish is also marked `eaten`, which is
// how enemies.js drops a body at its next step. The marks on its skin are kept in `marks`
// (look/wounds.js), and a wounded fish's bleeding carries what is left over of its next puff
// from step to step in `bleedRun`.
//
// Splatter draws from a random stream of its own, not the combat's: how much blood flies must
// never change what the enemies or the director do next.
