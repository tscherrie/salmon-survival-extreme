// What Extreme adds to the title card. The base game lays the card out itself (index.html,
// style.css, intro.js) and leaves room for an extension: a place under the start and rows
// among the settings. Extreme puts the co-op in that place (the offer to open a room, or the
// room) and the difficulty first among the settings; it adds the shooting to the keys and
// takes the vegan switch out, as there is no vegan mode here (wild.js). In a co-op room the
// card changes a little: no line about the game, the lobby where the start would be, and in
// the pause neither the saved stage nor "new game", as a game swum together is never saved.
//
// All of it is done as this module is read (layOutCard, called by extreme.js), before the
// game puts the card up, so that the card goes up as it is meant to look. Only the graphics
// steps' tooltips wait for init (finishCard): the game builds its picker as it starts.
