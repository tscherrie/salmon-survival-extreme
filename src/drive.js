// The drive: the smolt run's trial. Where the lower river spreads out wide and shallow at
// the edges, a band of goosanders waits for the smolts coming down. They hunt together:
// under water they circle the school and dash in at any smolt out on its own, driving the
// rest toward the shallows. The school does not wait -- it flees down the river at its own
// pace, closing up, flashing open round a bird and closing again -- and the fish has to
// keep up with it, in the middle of it, to the rapids below, where the birds give up.
//
// Here: when it starts and ends, and the school's lead (its middle, going down the river
// along the deep line). The birds are in predators.js (kind "drive"), the school in
// school.js.
